My first Techdegree project - Random Quote Generator

This webapp displays random quotes each time a button is clicked. The quotes are held in an array of quote objects with various properties.

There are three main functions to apply logic:

- getRandomQuote() - gets a random quote from the 'quotes' array and returns the inner object
- getRandomColor() - creates an array of three randomly generated rbg values
- printQuote() - calls the above two functions to display a random quote from the list with random rbg color values
